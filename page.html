      <p>Here's a time line of Viktor's life:</p>
      <article id="tribute-info">
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1962</strong> - Born in Leningrad (now known as Saint Petersburg)</li>
          <br/>
          <li>
            Tsoi grew up in the vicinity of the Moskovsky Victory Park. He was
            born in a maternity hospital on Kuznetsovskaya Street (located
            inside the park). The family lived in the notable "general's house"
            at the corner of Moskovsky Avenue and Basseynaya Street (the
            building is now an architectural monument). For some time Tsoi
            studied at a nearby school in Frunze Street, where his mother
            worked.
          </li>
          <br/>
          <li>
            From <strong>1974</strong> until <strong>1977</strong>, Tsoi attended a secondary art school, where he
            was a member of the band Palata # 6
          </li>
          <br/>
          <li>
            From <strong>1977</strong>, he attended the Serov Art School, until he was expelled
            in <strong>1979</strong> for poor performance. Afterwards, he attended SGPTU-61,
            where he was studying to become a wood carver. In his youth, he was
            a fan of Mikhail Boyarsky and Vladimir Vysotsky, and later Bruce
            Lee, after whom he started modelling his image. He was fond of
            martial arts and often sparred "in Chinese" with bandmate Yuri
            Kasparyan.
          </li>
          <br/>
          <li>
            Tsoi began writing songs at the age of 17. In the <strong>1970</strong>s and the
            <strong>1980</strong>s, rock music was an underground movement limited mostly to
            Leningrad. The Leningrad Rock Club was one of the few public places
            where rock bands were allowed to perform.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            At the Leningrad Rock Club, Tsoi played as a solo artist supported
            by members of the band Aquarium. Tsoi's lyrics and music impressed
            the crowd. In the summer of <strong>1981</strong>, Tsoi, Rybin, and Oleg Valinsky
            formed the band Garin i giperboloydy,
            lit. 'Garin and the hyperboloids'). The name was a homage to the
            classic Russian novel The Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin by Aleksey
            Tolstoy. In autumn of the same year, the band was admitted to
            membership of the Leningrad Rock Club. Not long after, Valinsky was
            conscripted into the army, leaving only Tsoi and Rybin, who renamed
            the band to Kino. Kino began recording its debut album in the spring
            of 1982.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Kino began recording its debut album, 45, in the spring of <strong>1982</strong> at
            Andrei Tropillo's studio. Members of Aquarium also took part in the
            recording, with Boris Grebenshchikov directing the album. The album
            got some distribution and Kino performed in many apartment concerts
            in Moscow and Leningrad.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            On 19 February <strong>1983</strong>, a joint concert with Kino and Aquarium took
            place.After the concert, Yuri Kasparyan was invited to join the band
            as a guitarist. In the spring, Rybin left Kino due to disagreements
            with Tsoi. Tsoi and Kasparyan spent the summer on joint rehearsals.
            As a result, Kino recorded the album 46, which was initially thought
            of as a demo for Nachalnik Kamchatki.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            In the fall of <strong>1983</strong>, Tsoi went to a psychiatric hospital in
            Pryazhka, where he spent a month and a half. As a result, Tsoi was
            not conscripted into the army. After being discharged from the
            psychiatric hospital, he wrote the song "Trankvilizator"
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            "Peremen!/"My zhdyom peremen" ("Changes!"/"We are waiting for
            changes"), first performed by Tsoi in the summer of <strong>1986</strong>, quickly
            became an important political song, an embodiment of the spirit of
            the Perestroika.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <strong>1987</strong> was a breakthrough year for Kino. The release of their 6th
            album Gruppa Krovi 
            triggered what was then called "Kinomania". The open political
            climate under glasnost allowed Tsoi to make Gruppa Krovi, his most
            political album, yet it also allowed him to record a sound of music
            that no one before him had been able to play
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            He also went on tour in <strong>1988-1989</strong> to Italy, France, and Denmark.
            Kino's finest hour came in <strong>1990</strong> with a concert at Moscow's Luzhniki
            Stadium; 62,000 fans filled the stands to celebrate the triumph of
            the USSR's most successful rock group.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            On 15 August <strong>1990</strong>, in Latvia, Tsoi was driving on the Sloka – Talsi
            highway, near Tukums and Riga. At 12:28 p.m., Tsoi died in a car
            collision.
